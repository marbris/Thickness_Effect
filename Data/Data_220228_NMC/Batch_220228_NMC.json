	"Comments": 		["I finally got the commercial PVDF from MSE Supplies (same supplier as Redox.me I think). So now I'm repeating the slurry from 211202, which worked great.",
                   "The slurry was very thick after the first 30min 2krpm mixing, so I added about 0.4ml of NMP and mixed for another 15min at 2krpm. It make less viscous and looked good.",
                   "This time I also taped the aluminum foil to aluminum plates instead of paper. The idea is that that it should prevent aluminum and paper warping during drying. On the first plate I used very strong tape. The process of attaching it was very risky and unstable. The next plate had the weaker paper tape. It was easier to attach.", 
                   "The strips did not end up smooth. 1400 has visible bubbles, the edges of some of these has exposed Al. 1200 also has visible bubbles, but less so. 1200 has a small amount of cracks. 900 has no bubbles, but there are larger round brighter segments. I believe these come from bubbles I burst with a needle while wet. My guess is that these bubbles are caused by my using of a syringe(without needle) to transfer the slurry from the plastic container onto the aluminum. I think it mixes air into the slurry which doesn't leave during drying.",
                   "For the next time, I need to trasfer the slurry without a syringe. I think I also need to mix in the extra NMP before mixing it all together. Because for 900 I see transparent areas, which I'm guessing are just NMP without any slurry",
                   "The data was bad. So I asked Xiaoyu to make a few coin cells to see if I was doing something wrong. He discovered that I had been using the wrong electrolyte (without Li). He made #13 and #14. #14 has the correct electrolyte and I have put it in the cycler together with six 220203_NMC coin cells"],
