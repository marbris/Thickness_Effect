	"Comments": 		["Xiaoyu made this slurry with me watching. I Could not see him doing anything differently. we made 1400, 1200, and 1000. The 1200 was applied to the foil with a syringe while 1400 and 1000 were poured from the cup.",
                   "The spreads came out with severe cracks. Xiaoyu suggested that its because they're so thick, and that we should either add more binder, or let the wet spreads dry in a drawer for a few hours before putting them in the oven.",
                   "There was a very small amount of bubbles on the syringe applied spread while none on the other two. I won't use the syringe again."],
